# Creating a To-Do List App with React and Material-UI

In this guide, we will create a To-Do List application using React and Material-UI. The app will have the following features:

## Features

- Add new to-do items
- Delete to-do items
- Edit existing to-do items
- Mark to-do items as checked
- Store to-do items in local storage
- Notifications for each action (add, delete, edit, check)

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of React and JavaScript
- Node.js installed on your machine

## Steps to Create the To-Do List App

1. **Create React App:**
  [√]- Use `npx create-react-app todo-list-app` to create a new React project.

2. **Install Material-UI:**
  [√] - Install Material-UI by running `npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled`.

3. **Create Components:**
  [√]- Create components for the To-Do List, To-Do Item, and Notification.

4. **Implement Add Functionality:**
   [√]- Allow users to add new to-do items and update the local storage.

5. **Implement Delete Functionality:**
   [√]- Enable users to delete to-do items and update the local storage.

6. **Implement Edit Functionality:**
   [√]- Implement the ability to edit to-do items and update the local storage.

7. **Implement Check Functionality:**
   [√]- Allow users to mark to-do items as checked and update the local storage.

8. **Add Notifications:**
   - Display notifications for each action (add, delete, edit, check).

9. **Update Local Storage:**
   - Ensure that all buttons update the local storage to persist the to-do items.

10. **Test and Refine:**
    - Test the app thoroughly to ensure all features work as expected.
    - Refine the user interface and functionality based on feedback.

## Things to Avoid

- Avoid using inline styles; instead, utilize Material-UI's styling solution.
- Avoid direct manipulation of the DOM; use React's state and props for managing data.

By following these steps, you can create a functional To-Do List app with React and Material-UI that includes the specified features and functionality.
